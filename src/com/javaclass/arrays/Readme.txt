- Create a program to store 10 numbers in an array
    - print the entire array
    - print a specific element (remember to use the 'position' and 'index' correctly)
    - print the length of an array

- Write a program to ask user to enter the name of 5 of his friends: (Change the number 5 to anything you like)
    - the program should ask the user for the names one at a time (try and remember how we used scanner)
    - store each name in an array

    once the user has enter all names
    - print a list of all names

    - ask the user to give you the 'position' (e.g. 3) in the array
      - if the user gives a large number (position does not exist in array)
        - print an error and let the user know the maximum value he can enter
      - print the name at that position (remember - position is not the same as index)

** Optional (Good to do)
- Ask user if he wants to change any name
  - if user says "Y" or "Yes" (you can implement it any way you like)
    - ask for the position
    - ask for new name
    - change the value at that position

    - print the new array
